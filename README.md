# text-notes-react

Test assignment. Original description:

> Build a medium.com style commenting / notes system.
People can mark text and attach a comment to it.
You can assume that the editor will not change the text afterwards.
Make it work for a single user and a static text (no signup / login needed).
Please use a REST-API to manage storage in a DB.
You are free to use tools or frameworks that you feel comfortable with, but we prefer
NodeJS, React, Redux.
We know that you’re not a designer, but please try your best to make it look good
(e.g styling and transitions)
